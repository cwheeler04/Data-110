## Brief History Of the Washington Nationals
The Washington Nationals were founded in 2005 following the relocation of the Montreal Expos. 
The move brought a Major League Baseball team back to the nation's capital for the first time since 1971, 
ending a 34 year drought. From April to October, fans in the district regularly visit Nationals Park to watch the team play baseball. 

### Best Players in Franchise History
1. **Ryan Zimmerman** - *First Baseman* - Nicknamed "Mr. National," Zimmerman was the first player in Nationals history. He spent 16 years with the team after being drafted in 2005 and leads the team in most statistical categories like games played, home runs, and hits. His jersey #11 is retired by the team and he's a member of the teams ring of honor. 
2. **Max Scherzer** - *Pitcher* - Known for his aggressive demeanor and heterochromatic eyes, Scherzer is seen as the best pitcher in franchise history. While with the Nationals, the future MLB hall-of-famer was a 7 time all-star and 2 time Cy Young winner[^label].
3. **Juan Soto** - *Outfielder* - At just 19 years old, Soto debuted for the Nationals in 2018 and was immediately sensational. He led the team to a world series victory in 2019 and is viewed as the most talented hitter in Major League Baseball today.
